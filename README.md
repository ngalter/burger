# Eat-Da-Burger!

### Overview

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

* This version of the app has a "clean up" function so that devoured burgers can be deleted to make room on the page and help out during testing.

### Technologies

The Eat-Da-Burger application uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern.

### Deployment

This app is fully deployed on Heroku (front-end and database) at https://floating-taiga-20784.herokuapp.com/
